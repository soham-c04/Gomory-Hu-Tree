Applications of Dynamic GomoryHu Tree:-
1. Parametric analysis on cut-trees and its application on a protein clustering problem
Concepts:- Clustering of protein structures into strongly connected groups (Unit-edge weights).
	 - Parametric analysis for identifying sensitive edges (based on parameter lambda).
	 - Identifying real PPI.

2. Markov Clustering Algorithm (MCL)
